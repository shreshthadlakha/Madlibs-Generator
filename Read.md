Simple Mad Libs Game

This is a cleaner and more concise version of the classic Mad Libs game in Python.

Instead of using multiple lines to ask the user for inputs, I've simplified the code by using a single identifier to collect multiple user inputs â€”making the code shorter, easier to read, and more efficient.

What's different?
- Less repetition
- Fewer lines of code
- Easier to modify or expand

Perfect for beginners who want to see how small tweaks can make code cleaner and more effective.
